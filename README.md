## About the project
This is a Node.js application that uses the Inquirer npm to generate a Readme markdown file based off of user input. This application creates a markdown template with all of the user input included inside for a desirable README. Once applied, users will me able to move, rename, and adjust the file accordingly.

### Built With

* Javascript
* Node.js
* Inquirer.js

### Testing


To access the code for the generator:

* Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Zd092718/zdreadmegenerator
    ```

To use this project, clone the project repository and access it from your command line. Type node index.js into your command line when inside the repository. The user will then be prompted by the terminal with questions regarding their project. After the prompts are answered, a success message will appear inside the terminal and a markdown file named "UREADME.md" will appear inside of the generator project folder. From there, the markdown file will be created, movable and adjustable as needed.
